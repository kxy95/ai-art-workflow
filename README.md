## Tools
### Stable Diffusion WebUI 
Source: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui
- Absolut great program and to top it all it's free.
- Easy to use all in one UI in Browser to use Stable Diffusion Models on your local GPU.

### Stable Diffusion WebUI Extensions
Source: See the "Extensions" tab in Stable Diffusion WebUI.
- ultimate-upscale-for-automatic1111 -> Script to upscale images to higher resolutions through Stable Diffusion
- sd-webui-controlnet -> Integration to use ControlNet
- sd-webui-additional-networks -> Integration to use LoRAs
- openOutpaint-webUI-extension -> Image Editor with direct access to the Stable Diffusion Model via API

### Models 
Source: https://civitai.com/
- Already an excessive amount of Models, Textual Inversions (TI), LORAs and Hypernetworks.
- Quality pretty mixed.

- You need a diffuser model.
- Many really good and well documented models.

### GPU
I use a GTX1070. 
It is somewhat limited in the initial size of an image you can generate with Stable Diffusion but I would say you can work with it very well.
Depending on the Model my maximum size is about 704x704 pixel.
At the moment only Nvidia Cards are supported but on a AMD support is worked on.

### Graphic Tablet
Not a hard requirement but absolutly necessary if you want to speed things up.
Often it is easier to actually - I know, crazy stuff - draw something than hitting a generate button till the model decides to give you what you are looking for.
